# Archives vs Content Repository

Notes:

- Speaking in general terms, with some help from wikipedia.


### What's an Archive?

> An **archive** is an accumulation of historical records or the physical place they are located.

Notes:

- Probably think of a library or a museum.


### What's a Content Repository?

> A content repository or content store is a database of digital content

Notes:

- Sometimes referred to a "digital library".


## So they're the same?

## A Little About the JCR

- Stands for Java Content Repository.
- Object database for storing, searching and retrieving hierarchical data.
- Specifies "versioning" and "access control".

Notes:

- If that sounds like a Drupal "node" that's because a "node" is essentially a "tree node" in a content repository.
- There are PHP implementations of the JCR.
  - Helpfully called PHPCR.
- I _thought_ Fedora implemented the JCR standard, but I think I've been corrected previously.
