# So What Can We Do With It?


## Document Collaboration

- Multiple people creating, annotating, revising and publishing one document.
- Use workflows and stamps to add metadata to version history.
- Every revision is stored.


## Media Library

- Store common media assets.
- Store metadata on objects that can be updated as standards change.
- Use API to serve assets to multiple sites.


## Replace Nodes ðŸ™€

- Drupal nodes _wish_ they were JCR nodes.
- Many work-arounds built in SQL to do versioning, fields, access control, etc.
